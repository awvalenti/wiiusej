# wiiusej
A Java API for Wiimotes, fork of [guiguito's wiiusej](https://github.com/guiguito/wiiusej), originally on [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/wiiusej/)

## Dependencies
wiiusej includes binaries from
[wiiuse](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ruth/year4VEs/Labs/wiiuse.html),
a native Wiimote library by Michael Laforest.

## Changes from original version
- Project splitted into Maven modules
- Detecting operating system automatically
- Unpacking appropriate native libraries from JAR file to temp directory

## Installation
You can either:
- download a [released JAR](../../releases) and add it to the build path of your project
- use a dependency management tool like [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) or [Gradle](http://gradle.org/)

For the second option, there is a free service called [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/) that allows adding a project hosted on GitHub as a dependency. It downloads source code, builds JARs and serves them to you.

To use wiiusej on a Maven project, add this to your pom.xml:

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.awvalenti.wiiusej</groupId>
    <artifactId>wiiusej-lib</artifactId>
    <version>v0.13</version>
  </dependency>
    <!--
      Here goes either a git tag correponding to a released version,
      a commit hash or the string "-SNAPSHOT" (without the quotes,
      with the hyphen). The example below uses a git tag.
    -->
    <version>v0.13</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
